# 🔐 Ethical Wi-Fi Penetration Test (Lab Demo)

**Objective:**  
Simulated an **authorized** Wi-Fi penetration test to capture WPA2 handshakes and evaluate password security.

**Key Tools:**  
`Airodump-ng` • `Aircrack-ng` • `Hashcat` • `Wireshark`

**Workflow Highlights:**
1. Captured WPA handshake packets using `Airodump-ng`.
2. Verified EAPOL 4-way handshake in `Wireshark`.
3. Tested password cracking with dictionary attacks in `Aircrack-ng` & GPU acceleration in `Hashcat`.
